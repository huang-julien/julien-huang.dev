# Sponsors

Open source is something I love doing in my free time. I usually spend at least 10+ hours a week on it — whether it’s helping with issues, reviewing and fixing PRs, or adding new features to the projects I’m part of.

Huge thanks to all my past and current sponsors — your support seriously means a lot!
