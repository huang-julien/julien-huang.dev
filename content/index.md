# Julien Huang

## Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Julien.**
Frontend developer by day, open-source contributor by night.

I'm currently working for Leetchi in France as a frontend technical lead.

Outside my day job, i'm also part of the Nuxt Core Team. And as a self taught developer, open-source is my way to learn and improve myself.

When i'm not programming, I like to spend time playing video games, music and powerlifting.
