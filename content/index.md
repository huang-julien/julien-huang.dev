Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julien -- a frontend developer by day, open-source contributor by night.

I currently work at Leetchi in France as a frontend technical lead.

Outside of my day job, I'm part of the Nuxt Core Team. As a self-taught developer, open source has been a huge part of how I learn and grow.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me playing video games, making music, or powerlifting.
